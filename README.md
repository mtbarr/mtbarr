# Welcome.

I am Matheus, a software developer with a sharp focus on creating efficient, scalable, and maintainable systems. My primary expertise is in **Java** and **Kotlin**, where I leverage precision and structure to deliver robust solutions. Beyond these core languages, I am currently expanding my skill set by diving into the intricacies of **Go**, **Rust**, and **Zig**â€”languages that demand a deeper understanding of performance and minimalism.

In my free time, I explore creative engineering by developing tools and modifications for Minecraft. This hobby pushes me to think outside conventional boundaries and experiment with practical, real-world constraints.

My professional interests lie in the domain of financial technology, especially in the design of banking systems and operational software. I am particularly drawn to the challenge of creating secure and reliable platforms that meet the demands of modern financial ecosystems. The intersection of technical rigor and critical societal needs is where I thrive.
